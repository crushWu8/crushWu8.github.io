======
I am a Mathematics B.S. student at Northeastern University graduating in 2026. I focus on blending mathematical modeling with modern computational tools to enable data informed decision making. I have experience in statistical analysis, database management, and visualization, and I am proficient in Python and MySQL for turning raw data into meaningful insights. My interests include combinatorics, graph theory, and applied machine learning with an emphasis on clean, reproducible workflows and clear communication.

My projects include pursuit and evasion on chess graphs, burning processes on strong path products, and a machine learning pipeline for hospital readmission risk that covered modeling, validation, and visual reporting. I am actively seeking opportunities in applied mathematics and data science including research collaborations and internships where elegant theory connects to usable systems and real world impact.
